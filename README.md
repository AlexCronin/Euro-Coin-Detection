**Euro Coin Detection and Recognition**
========================


Introduction
------------------------
This is an object recognition project whose aim is to try and recognise the Euro coins in an image. The plan is to use image processing techniques to isolate the coins in an image and then use machine learning to recognise the denomination of those coins.

Technologies
------------------------
This project uses OpenCV which is a computer vision and machine learning library. I am using this in conjunction with Python. For the object classification part of the system I am using Keras and TensorFlow.

Results

How To Run
------------------------
1.	Get dataset from here https://github.com/AlexCronin/FYP/tree/master/EuroCoinDataset/train
2.	Run createmodel.py (you'll need to edit it to point at the new dataset location)
3.	Run classificationPLT.py and select an image to input into the system when prompted.
